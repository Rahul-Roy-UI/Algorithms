## üß† Problems & Concepts Covered

### ‚úÖ Basic Algorithm Challenges

1. **FizzBuzz**  
   Print numbers from 1 to _n_, replacing multiples of 3 with `"Fizz"`, multiples of 5 with `"Buzz"`, and multiples of both with `"FizzBuzz"`.

2. **isPalindrome**  
   Check if a string or number reads the same forwards and backwards.

3. **Reverse Words**  
   Reverse the words in a given sentence or string.

4. **Reverse Array In Place**  
   Reverse the elements of an array without using a new array.

5. **Two Sum**  
   Find two numbers in an array that add up to a target sum.

6. **Binary Search**  
   Search a sorted array efficiently using divide-and-conquer.

7. **Factorial**  
   Calculate the factorial of a number using recursion or iteration.

8. **Fibonacci**  
   Return the _n_th number in the Fibonacci sequence (recursive or iterative).

9. **Bubble Sort**  
   Sort an array using the bubble sort algorithm.

10. **Merge Sort**  
    Sort an array using the efficient merge sort algorithm (divide and conquer).

11. **Flatten Array of Arrays**  
    Flatten nested arrays into a single-level array.

12. **Count Duplicate Elements**  
    Count how many times each element appears in an array or string.

13. **Prime Numbers**  
    Check whether a number is prime and/or generate a list of primes.

#### 00 - Core Number & Pattern Challenges

01. **Largest Number in Array**  
    Find the largest number in an array by iterating and comparing each value.

02. **Second Largest Number in Array**  
    Find the second largest distinct number in an array, accounting for edge cases and duplicates.

03. **Right-Angled Triangle Pattern**  
    Use nested loops to print a right-angled triangle pattern of asterisks.

04. **Count Digits**  
    Count the number of digits in a given integer. Handles negative numbers using `Math.abs()` and uses a loop with `Math.floor()`.

05. **Palindrome Number**  
    Check if an integer reads the same forwards and backwards without using strings.

06. **Reverse Integer**  
    Reverse a 32-bit signed integer's digits, returning 0 if the result overflows the 32-bit signed integer range [‚àí2¬≥¬π, 2¬≥¬π ‚àí 1].

#### 01 - Array Manipulation

01. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**  
    Remove duplicates in-place from a sorted array using two pointers and return the new length.

02. **Remove Element from Array**  
    Remove all occurrences of a given value from an array in-place and return the new length.

03. **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock**  
    Find the maximum profit by buying and selling a stock once using a single pass with min tracking.

04. **Maximum Profit from Single Buy & Sell**  
    Efficient stock profit maximization using min-so-far and max-profit logic.

05. **Move Zeroes**  
    Shift all zeroes to the end of an array while maintaining the order of non-zero elements.

06. **Max Consecutive Ones**  
    Count the maximum number of consecutive 1s in a binary array.

07. **Missing Number**  
    Find the missing number in a sequence from 0 to _n_ using the sum difference method.

08. **Single Number**  
    Find the element that appears only once in an array where every other element appears twice using XOR.

### ‚öôÔ∏è JavaScript Concepts

01. **Pure Functions**  
    Functions with no side effects that return the same output for the same input.

02. **Function Currying**  
    Transform a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions with one argument each.

03. **Callback Functions**  
    Functions passed as arguments to other functions and executed later.

04. **Closures**  
    Inner functions that remember variables from their outer scope.

05. **Closures with setTimeout**  
    Explore closure behavior when used with `setTimeout` (commonly in loops).

06. **Deep Clone**  
    Recursively copy all nested levels of objects and arrays to prevent reference-related bugs.

07. **Add Numbers**  
    Simple function to add multiple numbers together, demonstrating concepts like rest parameters or recursion.

08. **Event Bubbling, Capturing, and Delegation**  
    Understand how events propagate in the DOM and how to manage them using event delegation. Includes concepts like `event.stopPropagation()` and `event.target`.
