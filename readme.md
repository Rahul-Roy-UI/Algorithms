## üß† Problems & Concepts Covered

### ‚úÖ Basic Algorithm Challenges

1. **FizzBuzz**  
    Print numbers from 1 to _n_, replacing multiples of 3 with `"Fizz"`, multiples of 5 with `"Buzz"`, and multiples of both with `"FizzBuzz"`.

2. **isPalindrome**  
    Check if a string or number reads the same forwards and backwards.

3. **Reverse Words**  
    Reverse the words in a given sentence or string.

4. **Reverse Array In Place**  
    Reverse the elements of an array without using a new array.

5. **Two Sum**  
    Find two numbers in an array that add up to a target sum.

6. **Binary Search**  
    Search a sorted array efficiently using divide-and-conquer.

7. **Factorial**  
    Calculate the factorial of a number using recursion or iteration.

8. **Fibonacci**  
    Return the _n_th number in the Fibonacci sequence (recursive or iterative).

9. **Bubble Sort**  
    Sort an array using the bubble sort algorithm.
 
10. **Merge Sort**  
    Sort an array using the efficient merge sort algorithm (divide and conquer).

11. **Flatten Array of Arrays**  
    Flatten nested arrays into a single-level array.

12. **Largest Number in Array**  
    Find the largest number in an array by iterating and comparing each value.

13. **Second Largest Number in Array**  
    Find the second largest distinct number in an array, accounting for edge cases and duplicates.

14. **Count Digits**  
    Count the number of digits in a given integer. Handles negative numbers using `Math.abs()` and uses a loop with `Math.floor()` to reduce the number step-by-step.

15. **palindromeNumber**  
    Check if an integer reads the same forwards and backwards without using strings.

16. **Reverse Integer**
    Reverse a 32-bit signed integer's digits, returning 0 if the result overflows the 32-bit signed integer range [ ‚àí 2^31 , 2^31 ‚àí 1 ] [‚àí2^31 ,2^31 ‚àí1].

### ‚öôÔ∏è JavaScript Concepts

12. **Pure Functions**  
    Functions with no side effects that return the same output for the same input.

13. **Function Currying**  
    Transforming a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions with one argument each.

14. **Count Duplicate Elements**  
    Count how many times each element appears in an array or string.

15. **Callback Functions**  
    Functions passed as arguments to other functions and executed later.

16. **Closures**  
    Inner functions that remember variables from their outer scope.

17. **Closures with setTimeout**  
    Explore closure behavior when used with `setTimeout` (commonly in loops).

18. **Deep Clone**  
    Recursively copy all nested levels of objects and arrays to prevent reference-related bugs.

19. **Prime Numbers**  
    Check whether a number is prime and/or generate a list of primes.

20. **Add Numbers**  
    Simple function to add multiple numbers together, demonstrating concepts like rest parameters or recursion.

21. **Event Bubbling, Capturing, and Delegation**  
    Understand how events propagate in the DOM and how to manage them using event delegation. Includes concepts like `event.stopPropagation()` and `event.target`.
