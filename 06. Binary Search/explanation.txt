Certainly! Let's delve into the differences between the slice() and splice() methods in JavaScript, which are often confused due to their similar names but serve distinct purposes.

🔹 slice() – Non - Mutating Subarray Extraction
Purpose:
slice() is used to create a shallow copy of a portion of an array without modifying the original array.

    Syntax:

let newArray = array.slice(startIndex, endIndex);
startIndex: The index at which to begin extraction(inclusive).

    endIndex(optional): The index at which to end extraction(exclusive).If omitted, it extracts through the end of the array.

Key Characteristics:

Non - mutating: Does not alter the original array.

Returns a new array: Contains the selected elements.

Negative indices: Can be used to count from the end of the array.

    Example:


let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let sliced = arr.slice(1, 3); // [2, 3]
console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] — original array remains unchanged
🔹 splice() – Mutating In - Place Modification
Purpose:
splice() is used to change the contents of an array by removing, replacing, or adding elements in place.

    Syntax:


let removedItems = array.splice(startIndex, deleteCount, item1, item2, ...);
startIndex: The index at which to start changing the array.

    deleteCount: The number of elements to remove(optional).

        item1, item2, ... (optional): Items to add to the array, starting at the startIndex.

Key Characteristics:

Mutating: Alters the original array.

Returns an array: Contains the deleted elements.

Negative indices: Can be used to count from the end of the array.

    Example:


let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let removed = arr.splice(1, 2, 'a', 'b'); // Removes 2 and 3, adds 'a' and 'b'
console.log(arr); // [1, 'a', 'b', 4, 5]
console.log(removed); // [2, 3]
🔍 Comparison Table
Feature	slice()	splice()
Mutates Original	❌ No	✅ Yes
Returns	✅ New array with selected elements	✅ Array of removed elements
Use Case	Extracting a subarray	Adding, removing, or replacing elements
Negative Indices	✅ Yes	✅ Yes

✅ When to Use Which ?
    Use slice() when you need to extract a portion of an array without modifying the original array.

    Use splice() when you need to add, remove, or replace elements in the original array.

🎨 Visual Analogy
Think of slice() as cutting a piece of cake to serve to someone without altering the original cake, whereas splice() is like cutting a piece of cake and replacing it with a new flavor in the same spot.
