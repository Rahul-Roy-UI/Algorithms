## 🧠 Problems & Concepts Covered

### ✅ Basic Algorithm Challenges

1. **FizzBuzz**  
   Print numbers from 1 to n, replacing multiples of 3 with `"Fizz"`, multiples of 5 with `"Buzz"`, and multiples of both with `"FizzBuzz"`.

2. **isPalindrome**  
   Check if a string or number reads the same forwards and backwards.

3. **Reverse Words**  
   Reverse the words in a given sentence or string.

4. **Reverse Array In Place**  
   Reverse the elements of an array without using a new array.

5. **Two Sum**  
   Find two numbers in an array that add up to a target sum.

6. **Binary Search**  
   Search a sorted array efficiently using divide-and-conquer.

7. **Factorial**  
   Calculate the factorial of a number using recursion or iteration.

8. **Fibonacci**  
   Return the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence (recursive or iterative).

9. **Bubble Sort**  
   Sort an array using the bubble sort algorithm.

10. **Merge Sort**  
   Sort an array using the efficient merge sort algorithm (divide and conquer).

11. **Flatten Array of Arrays**  
   Flatten nested arrays into a single-level array.

### ⚙️ JavaScript Concepts

12. **Pure Functions**  
   Functions with no side effects that return the same output for the same input.

13. **Function Currying**  
   Transforming a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions with one argument each.

14. **Count Duplicate Elements**  
   Count how many times each element appears in an array or string.

15. **Callback Functions**  
   Functions passed as arguments to other functions and executed later.

16. **Closures**  
   Inner functions that remember variables from their outer scope.

17. **Closures with setTimeout**  
   Explore closure behavior when used with `setTimeout` (commonly in loops).

18. **Prime Numbers**  
   Check whether a number is prime and/or generate a list of primes.

19. **Add Numbers**  
   Simple function to add multiple numbers together, demonstrating concepts like rest parameters or recursion.
